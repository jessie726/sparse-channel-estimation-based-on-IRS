# sparse-channel-estimation-based-on-IRS
Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) is a technology with low hardware cost, low power consumption, and the ability to reconfigure the wireless communication environment, which has attracted widespread attention. However, the use of IRS intelligent reconfigurable environment is premised on obtaining accurate channel state information, and it is challenging to accurately capture channel state information in large multiple-input multiple-output systems assisted by IRS, and channel estimation is also a key challenge for IRS-assisted systems.
